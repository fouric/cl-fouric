    description: just a place to put stuff for working on cl-fouric (common-code) sub-projects, like f:narrower

todo:
    fix bug where, if you shrink the window, there can be a race condition where you use the old value of the window size and draw outside of the new window
    make charms handle explicit so you don't get athena crashes when you load cl-fouric in another system in the same image

inbox:
    make f:auto(complete) module/object that maybe integrates with f:narrower?
    steal features from rofi (https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) to use in f:narrower
    build pop-up mode for f:narrower, and daemon mode, and integration into SDL program
    athena currently wants a narrower that does NOT automatically reset when narrowed to a single option (polled in INBOX-SORT-HANDLE-INPUT, not hooked), that
        that's actually kind of what we do now - try to swap it in and see what happens
    narrower: also add option to throw error or run hook when narrowed to zero entries
